                          A Master of Data Science program in the UK is an
                          advanced, intensive course of study designed to impart
                          a deep understanding of data analysis, machine
                          learning, and statistical methods, typically over one
                          year full-time or two years part-time. The curriculum
                          is structured to provide students with both
                          theoretical knowledge and practical skills in
                          handling, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets.
                          Students learn through a combination of lectures,
                          workshops, project work, and often a dissertation
                          focused on solving real-world data challenges.
